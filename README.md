# MIPS-Datapath-Evaluator-
The implementation of group one was simple.  
The datapath already included all of the modules need to implement group one which includes the following instructions: 
add, sub, slt, andi, and nor.  In order to implement each of the instructions I used the appropriate function code based instruction
type and the operation that needed to be done.  I added the information directly to the mips-control file following the format to the 
already provided add operation.  I implemented each step individually and tested each step separately before creating a test bench that 
mixed the various combinations of instructions.  The test bench instructions were created by adding the instruction to the assembly file 
which allowed me to get a hexadecimal value that was transferred to the program.txt file.  The output of the test file can be see below 
as well as the instructions implemented.
